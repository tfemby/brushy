        colorzero is a color manipulation library for Python (yes, another
        one) which aims to be reasonably simple to use and "pythonic" in
        nature.

        It does not aim to be as comprehensive, powerful, or that matter
        as correct as, say, colormath. colorzero originally grew out of
        work on my picamera project, hence it's intended to be sufficiently
        simple that school children can use it without having to explain
        color spaces and illuminants. However, it does aim to be useful to
        a wide range of skills, hence it does include basic facilities for
        CIE Lab representations, and Delta-E calculations should you need
        them.
