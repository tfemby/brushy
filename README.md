# Contributing
If you're inclined, give me some code to help improve a build ðŸ™‚ I can't
guarantee I'll add your changes for whatever reason.

Ebuilds in this repo follow the GPL-2 license. This is mostly because some
of ebuilds are derivitives of already existing ebuilds from the gentoo repo.
Contributing here means that you will need to accept this license.
