# Brushy - Personal ebuild testing repo
This repo is just here to host my personal collection of ebuilds and packages related to it.

So far app-editors/neovide is the only build that is worth merging.

## TODO:
 - Work out how to use skia-bindings binaries. https://github.com/rust-skia/rust-skia/discussions/824
