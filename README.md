# Contributing
If you're inclined, give me some code to help improve a build ðŸ™‚ I can't
guarantee I'll add it for a variety of reasons.

Ebuilds in this repo follow the GPL-2 license. This is mostly because some
ebuilds are derivitives of already existing ebuilds from the gentoo repo or
the wayland-desktop repo. Contributing here means that you will need to accept
this license before submitting code.
