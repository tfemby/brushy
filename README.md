# Brushy - Desktop ebuild repo
This repo is primarily created to host ebuilds of packages I personally use.

If you have any issues with an ebuilds, feel free to open an issue. 

If you're inclined, give me some code to help improve a build ðŸ™‚ I can't
guarantee I'll add your changes for whatever reason.

### Packages worthy of emerge
- app-editors/neovide
- x11-misc/rofi-emoji

### TODO
- Work on using a vendor tarball correctly
  - Likely need to work out what `cargo.eclass` is doing which workflows aren't currently doing.
